# 🚀 CredifyAI – ML Credit Risk Classifier

> An end-to-end machine learning system for predicting borrower credit risk using structured financial and repayment data.

Built with **XGBoost**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **SHAP**, this project demonstrates practical ML workflows including feature engineering, model training, and explainable AI.

---

## 📌 Overview

CredifyAI predicts credit risk levels (**Low** / **Moderate** / **High**) by analyzing:
- Financial history
- Income patterns
- Loan attributes
- Repayment behavior

The goal is to build a practical and interpretable credit scoring system aligned with real-world financial risk assessment practices.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Accurate credit risk prediction helps financial institutions:
- ✅ Reduce defaults
- ✅ Automate lending decisions
- ✅ Detect risky borrowing behavior early
- ✅ Improve the reliability of credit scoring systems

Traditional rule-based scoring models can be rigid and limited. CredifyAI uses machine learning to deliver **adaptive** and **explainable** credit-risk predictions.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 **XGBoost-based credit risk classifier**
- 🏗️ **3-stage ML pipeline**: preprocessing → feature engineering → model training
- ⚙️ **10–15 engineered features** (DTI, utilization ratio, delinquency metrics, etc.)
- ⚖️ **Class imbalance handling** with SMOTE or class weights
- 📈 **Explainable ML** using SHAP
- 📊 **Visual insights**: feature importance, heatmaps, SHAP plots
- 📦 **Modular and extendable** codebase
